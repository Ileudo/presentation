          <h2>Type Alias vs Interace</h2>
          <aside class="notes">
            Today I'm going to delve into the world of typescript and answer the question what’s better to use:
            interfaces or types. Why do they both exist because they seem to do the same thing. The short answer is it
            doesn't matter. By and large, there's preferences that you can have for each one and there are some
            differences in their behavior. But as typescript has matured over the years, the feature sets of both an
            interface and a type have gotten more and more similar. There's still differences and still constraints
            about which one’s can do but, by and large, they are more the same than ever today. Most of the times type
            aliases in typescript are used to alias a more complex type like a union of other types to a reusable name.
            On the other hand interfaces are used for more traditional object-oriented purposes where you define the
            shape of an object and then use that as a contract for function parameters ... or for classes to implement.
            And this is probably one of the more fundamental differences between types and interfaces. But type aliases
            and interfaces are also very similar in a variety of ways.

            Here I have an interface for an animal and a type that's aliasing the shape of this object to this name. And
            these two types are mostly equivalent. If I have a variable that's typed to my interface and I have another
            variable that's typed to my type alias I can assign one to the other without typescript complaining. And
            that's because typescript uses structural typing so as long as these two types have the same structure, it
            doesn't really matter that they're distinct types. And I can prove this by changing the shape of one of
            these types. So if I change this property you'll notice typescript is now complaining.

          <h3>Similarities</h3>
          <pre><code data-trim data-noescape>
            interface IAnimal {
              age: number;
              speak(): string;
            }

            type AnimaTypeAlias = {
              age<span class="fragment fade-in">2</span>: number;
              speak(): void;
            };

            let animalInterface: IAnimal;
            let animalTypeAlias: AnimaTypeAlias;

            animalInterface = animalTypeAlias <span class="fragment fade-in">// Error: Property 'age' is missing in type 'AnimaTypeAlias' but required in type 'IAnimal'</span>

              Type aliases can act as an alias for a more complex type like a function in this case or an array. But I
              can also build the equivalent of this type using an interface. So these two types are now functionally
              equivalent. I can also build an equivalent of this type using an interface. Well, this type missing all
              the array methods that this type has. It still works pretty much like an array ... as its saying that all
              of its keys will be numbers and the values they're pointing to will be strings.
            </p>
          </aside>
          <h3>Functions and Arrays Typing</h3>
          <pre><code data-trim data-noescape>
            type Eat = (food: string) => void;
            type AnimalList = string[];

            interface IEat {
              (food: string): void;
            }

            interface IAnimalList {
              [index: number]: string;
            }
            </code></pre>
        </section>
        <section>
          <aside class="notes">
            So while this is an example of how similar interfaces and type aliases can be ... it's also an example of a
            case where it's more concise to use type aliases. With type aliases I can express a merge of different other
            types by means of intersection type. So here I've created a type Cat that's both the IPet and the IFeline.
            And if I create a new variable of this type and I try to access properties on it I can see it's giving me
            properties from both pets and felines. If I wanted to do this with an interface, although possible, I'd have
            to create a totally new interface to express that merge. So this new interface has to extend both pet and
            feline. And again if I try to create a new variable of this type and I try to access properties on it again
            I get both properties. So again functionally they're exactly the same here. However the difference is a bit
            more lexical.
          </aside>
          <h3>Intersection</h3>
          <pre><code data-trim data-noescape>
            type Cat = IPet & IFelid;
            interface ICat extends IPet, IFelid {}

            interface IPet {
              pet(): void;
            }

            interface IFelid {
              nightvision: boolean;
            }
            </code></pre>
        </section>
        <section>
          <aside class="notes">
            And there's also no difference between type aliases and interfaces when it comes to using them
            interchangeably. So an interface can extend both an interface and the type. A type can be an intersection of
            both an interface and another type. And even a class can implement both an interface and the type.
          </aside>
          <h3>Interchangeable Use</h3>
          <pre><code data-trim data-noescape>
            interface ICat extends IFelid, Pet {}

            type Cat = IFelid & Pet;

            class HouseCat implements IFelid, Pet {

          <aside class="notes">
            One of the biggest functional differences between type aliases and interfaces is that while with a type I
            can have a union of multiple other types. So in this case this is a type that can either be a dog or a cat.
            With interfaces this concept is not really possible. And if I try to extend this Union type I'll see that
            typescript complains. And that's because an interface is a specific contract. You can't make it be one thing
            or the other. It must be locked in a declaration. And the same goes for a class implementing one of these
            Union types. Typescript is gonna complain because the class is a blueprint for how to create instances of
            objects. It must be specific.
          </aside>
          <h3>Unions</h3>
          <pre><code data-trim data-noescape>
            type PetType = IDog | ICat;
            interface IPet extends PetType {}
            class Pet implements PetType {}

            interface IDog {}
            interface ICat {}
            </code></pre>
        </section>
        <section>
          <aside class="notes">
            Finally, another functional difference between interfaces and type aliases as if I have two interfaces with
            the same name ... when used they will be merged together. So if I try to access some properties on foo now
            I'll get both A and B. And this is something that types do not support.
          </aside>
          <h3>Declaraton merging</h3>
          <pre><code data-trim data-noescape>
            interface IFoo {
              a: string;
            }

            interface IFoo {
              b: string;
            }

            let foo: IFoo;
            </code></pre>
        </section>
        <section>
          <aside class="notes">
            So if I try to convert these to a type I'll get an error saying that it's a duplicate identifier.
          </aside>
          <h3>Declaraton merging</h3>
          <pre><code data-trim data-noescape>
            type Foo = {
              a: string;
            };

            type Foo = {
              b: string;
            }; <span class="fragment fade-in">// Error: Duplicate identifier 'Foo'</span>

            let foo: IFoo;

            So now let's consider this example importing jQuery and I'm trying to extend it by adding a new function to
            it. Now if I try to use that function here I'll get an error saying that this function doesn't exist on
            jQuery. And that's because it rightfully doesn't exist on the default jQuery interface as I've just added
            it. So now I don't really want to touch the library itself. I would really like to just extend it locally.
          </aside>
          <h3>Library Extension</h3>
          <pre><code data-trim data-noescape>
            import * as $ from 'jquery';

            $.fn.extend({
              hideChildren: function () {
                // ...
              },
            });

            $("test").hideChildren(); // Error: Property 'hideChildren' does not exist on type "JQuery HTMLElement"
            </code></pre>
        </section>
        <section>
          <aside class="notes">
            So to do that I'll go into this different file and I'll say that as part of the jQuery interface I want to
            add this new method.
          </aside>
          <h3>Library Extension</h3>
          <pre><code data-trim data-noescape>
            interface JQuery {
              hideChildren(): void;
            }
            </code></pre>
        </section>
        <section>
          <aside class="notes">
            Now if I go back to my file I'll see that now passes compilation and that's because of this behavior where
            typescript merges the declarations of interfaces with the same name. However if the library author didn't
            mark jQuery as an interface, I would not be able to do something like this. So as library authors it's
            especially important to mark your public API as interfaces versus type aliases.

            To recap, we've looked at how interfaces and type aliases are very similar. Both of them can refer to types
            that declare the structure of something. They also both support merging of different other types either via
            the intersection operator for type aliases or the extend keywords for interfaces. And you can also use them
            interchangeably so interfaces can extend from other interfaces and types aliases can be a combination of
            interfaces and types. And classes can implement types and interfaces. However you can't really do this if
            the type you're implementing is a union of one type or the other. And that's because both interfaces and
            classes need to have a shape locked down at the moment of declaration. And finally if you're a library
            author it's useful to expose your public types as interfaces to allow your consumers to extend them if
            needed.
